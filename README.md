# Predictive-Modeling---Target-Creation

An "adopted user" is a user who has logged into the product on three separate days in at least one seven-day period. The target definition for my model is target = 1 if a user is an adopted user else 0. I have written an easy function in python for identifying adopted users.

Thanks,
